portfolio: heading should use `font-size: clamp(40px, 8vw, 80px);` when width is less than 480px and after that it should have a fixed font-size of 60px.

I should create variables for fonts, colors and sizes, also there will be some animations so repeated animations should have stored in variables

also selected text hightlight should be brand green and text color black

header shouldn't have any shadow and once it scroll it should become glassmorphism

there should be two classes slate (dark mode) and default (light mode) \[future version\] 

slate: 
	heading color: rgb(230, 241, 255);
	sub heading color: color: rgb(136, 146, 176);
	color: `#8892b0`
	green: color: rgb(100, 255, 218);
	light-green: rgba(100, 255, 218, 0.8);
	green: `#64ffda`;
	font-color: `#a8b2d1`;
	footer-bg: `#020c1b`
	bg-color: `#0a192f`
	card-bg: `#172a45`
