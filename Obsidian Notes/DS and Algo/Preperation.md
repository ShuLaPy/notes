## Learn Common Data Structures and Algorithms

[**Data Structures**](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/#study-guides-list)

Data structures are your weapons. Choosing the right weapon for the right battle is the key to victory. Be very familiar about the strengths of each data structure and the time complexities for its various operations.

| Topic               |Priority|
|---------------------|--------|
|Array                |High    |
|String               |High    |
|Hash Table           |Mid     |
|Recursion            |Mid     |
|Sorting and Searching|High    |
|Matrix               |High    |
|Linked List          |Mid     |
|Queue                |Mid     |
|Stack                |Mid     |
|Tree                 |High    |
|Graph                |High    |
|Heap                 |Mid     |
|Trie                 |Mid     |
|Interval             |Mid     |
|Dynamic Programming  |Low     |
|Binary               |Low     |
|Math                 |Low     |
|Geometry             |Low     |

2. Bit Manipulation 
3. Hashing
4. Backtracking

## Learn Patterns

The idea behind these patterns is that once you’re familiar with a pattern, you’ll be able to solve dozens of problems with it. Once you’re familiar with a pattern, you’ll be able to solve dozens of problems with it. Furthermore, this strategy will made you confident to tackle unknown problems.

## 4.5 months plan (14 hours a week)

**1. Breadth-first preparation** - Revise every topic and then start practicing a variety of questions across all topics. This strategy is recommended if you have around a month to spare.

**2. Depth-first preparation** - Tackle one topic at a time - revise materials for a topic, practice lots of questions for that topic. After ensuring mastery of a topic, move on to the next topic. Repeat for all or selected topics. If you don't have much time, this might be the best way to prepare. You can focus on the High priority topics in our recommended study plan.

**3. Depth-first-then-breadth preparation** - Tackle one topic at a time - revise materials for a topic, practice a few questions for that topic. After ensuring mastery, move on to the next topic. Repeat for all topics. At the end, practice a variety of questions across all topics. This strategy takes more time than others, so it's recommended if you have more than a month.

> It's important to have some form of breadth-level studying / practicing in your schedule so that you don't forget about the earlier topics as you move on to later topics.

???+ tip "Tips from [Prajkta](https://medium.com/@praajaktaa/how-i-got-into-google-161c97913b8b)"

	- Solve 2 problems everyday if not more. Easy problems can vary and might take anywhere from 30 mins to an hour. Medium problems were actually hard for me (sometimes even easy were hard). Time box your medium problem solving duration to 1 hour. At the end of 15 mins if you do not know the solution, look it up and try to implement. At the end of an hour if your solution is not working or cannot make some test cases pass, just stop and look at the solution.
	- Weekends are your best friends! Utilize them the most. I personally had 1 “power weekend” as I call it where I completed almost all question of leetcode easy and some of medium.
	- Do not dedicate a complete week just to coding is what I suggest. Mix it up a little bit. Do some design from time to time. Watch some videos in the middle. Start enjoying the process of learning!

## System Design

The objective of system design interviews is to evaluate a candidate's skill at designing real-world software systems involving multiple components. System design questions are typically given to more senior candidates (with a few years of experience).

System Design Interviews are usually unstructured and open-ended, which are 45 to 60 minutes long. The questions are usually a prompt like “Design WhatsApp.” The expectation is to give a high-level design showing different components, connections, and trade-offs of design choice. Think the design at scale.
