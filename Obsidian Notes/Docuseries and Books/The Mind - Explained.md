With stories memory become strong, and we can memorise more things. 
Story, place and emotions are foundation of some of our strongest memories.

The **memory palace** technique is used to memorise things with ease, in this you just add things in the real route that you know, that you are aware of.

we can plant false memories into mind by confirming it and repeating it multiple times.

Our memory is error prone, but the future and past is somehow linked in the mind, so if someone forgots about the past then the link to the future also lost.

Our mind is a time machine we can go back and throw, in memories and imagination with ease. 
It allows us to troubleshoot upcoming experiences, to think through the ways in which events might unfold, potential obstacles that might come up, and the ways in which we might deal with those obstacles. 

And some scientists say the simulation engine between your ears does something even more profound It weaves together memories of the past and dreams of the future to create your sense of self.
