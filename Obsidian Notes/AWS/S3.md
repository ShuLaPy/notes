### Basics
- S3 is private by default
- S3 is a global storage platform
- It stores data in particular region and that data will never leave that region
- S3 is resilient - means data is replicated in availability zone in that region
- You select region when you create bucket
- it's public service, unlimited data and multi-users (millions of users can access)
- It is used to store all kind of data
- Objects - 
	- it's file, it maid of key and value (content being stored)
	- object can be 0 bytes to 5 TB
	- VersionID, Metadata, Access Control, Subresources
- Bucket - 
	- bucket is created in region
	- it will never leave that region until we decide
	- bucket name should be **Globally Unique**
	- it can hold unlimited objects, it's infinite scalable storage system
	- It has a flat structure, all objects are stored on same level (root level)

### Security
- S3 is private by default
- identity policy - what that identity can access
- resource policy - who can access that resource
- **bucket policy** define permissions for that bucket
- principal - which principal will affect by that policy - if it present then it's resource policy and if absent then identity policy
- ![[bucket-policy.png]]
- ![[bucket-condition.png]]
- `"Resource": "arn: aws: s3:::secretcatproject/boris/*'` we can restrict policy for particular object.
- **ACL** are legacy and not recommended - \[READ, RIGHT, READ_ACP, WRITE_ACP, FULL_CONTROL\]
- Block Public Access - This has highest priority and can override the policy and identity permissions. But as name suggest it only handle public access.

### Static Web Hosting

- This feature allows access via HTTP
- website endpoint is created - this domain is automatically generated
- for custom domain via Route 53
- S3 is much cheaper for static files compare to other compute services
- we can use **offload** large amount of data to s3 so distinguish it from costly compute logic
- cost - per GB per month (upto)
- transfer to S3 is free
- transfer outside of s3 is chargeable
- there is charge on actions that you perform on S3 (PUT, DELETE....)
