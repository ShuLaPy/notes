Show changes in commited files wrt dev branch

- push that branch to github/gitlab and just start creating the MR for dev branch
- It will show files changes and commites
- you can now check all the changes that you made in that branch highlighted
- when your work done just abort the MR creation process

How do I undo the most recent local commits in Git?

```
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
