1. **Problem Defination** [[Basics#What is Machine Learning?]]
	Know the type of the problem, which Machine Learning model will suite to solve that problem.


2. **Data** [[Basics#Types of Data]]
	Type of data we got to solve above problem


3. **Evaluation**
	In this step we need to define what success means to us. For a heart disease calssification our model should give 99% accuricy. For a car insurance company the model giving 95% accuracy for insurance claims is good to continue work.


4. **Features**
